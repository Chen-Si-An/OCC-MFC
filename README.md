# OCC-MFC
### This project employs OpenCASCADE library to implement data visualization under MFC framework, supporting IGES, STEP, STL files. Additionally, this application provides fundamental model transformation and camera manipulation.

  16.  Key delete: Push down the key delete to delete the selected model.
  
 **Note: In this project, the OpenCASCADE library is introduced into MFC in the way of extern dll, making it available for software developers to link this dll to their own applications.**
